# Chapter 3: Test coverage and optimization

This chapter covers the importance of test coverage and performance optimization.

#### Topics covered
- Measuring test coverage to see what percentage of code is tested
- Optimizing for performance using benchmarks and profiling
- Parallel testing to reduce test run time and detect data race issues
